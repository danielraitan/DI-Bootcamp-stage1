     <div class="sporting">At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni,
         who was impressed with his dribbling.He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
          under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.

    <div class="manchester">Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003 His transfer fee made him,
         at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.
        Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt,
         which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.
        Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.

     <div class="madrid">Ahead of the 2009-10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time,
             of £80 million (€94 million).His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained 
             a €1 billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing 
             the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Raúl already wore
              the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him
             by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.

     <div class="juve">Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a
             four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional 
             €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever
              for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need 
              for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support
               he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.

     <div class="manu">On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo,
             subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.The transfer was reported as costing an initial £12.85 million, 
             with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after
              Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time
               record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.
